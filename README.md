# Morse Encryptor

This module can be used to encrypt alphabet letter into Morse code. We input the letter we want to encrypt using numbers and the module will flash an LED light the corresponding Morse code of that letter. Written in Verilog, simulated and synthesized using Xilinx Vivado.

The main module can be found in the file **Morse_Encryptor.v**.

The simulation result can be found in the file **simulation.png**.
